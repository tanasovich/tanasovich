Hello! My name is Valentine. I'm a professional with experience in **test automation** and developing robust software solutions. Until recently, I worked as a **Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET)**, where I focused on creating and maintaining automated testing frameworks. I am currently involved in volunteer projects.

## Background

My background in **Automation of Technological Processes and Productions** from ONAT allows me to take a comprehensive approach to problem-solving and process optimization.

In my free time, I enjoy **running**, which helps me maintain discipline and focus, and **photography**, a hobby that sharpens my attention to detail.
